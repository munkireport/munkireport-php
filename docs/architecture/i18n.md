# Internationalization / Localization (i18n) #

## MunkiReport v5 ##

When you select a language from the language dropdown in the navigation area, you are redirected with a query parameter
called `?setLng=<two letter locale code>`.

This is stored by i18next as a cookie called `i18next`. There is no backend storage of the user preference.

## Laravel Default Implementation ##

To understand how i18n works in Laravel let's consider the default implementation:

* The locale is configured for the entire application in `config/app.php` (or .env).
* Individual actions have the ability to set the Locale themselves.
* The default implementation of the `users` table has a `locale` column containing the country code and locale eg. **en_US**.
* If the user record contains a locale that isn't empty, that will be used instead.
* The frontend does not implement any of this until you tell it to.

NOTE: Mostly the Laravel Backend Locale is not used at all by MunkiReport.
