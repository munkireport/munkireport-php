# Frontend NOTES (To be refined)

- Vite is configured to serve HTTPS with a self signed cert that you need to accept//exempt.
- VueJS3 is now the default (attempted Svelte+InertiaJS but was not production ready).
- There is one app entrypoint for the SPA components, and an `app-hybrid` entrypoint for components which appear on pages
  that are otherwise just jQuery.
