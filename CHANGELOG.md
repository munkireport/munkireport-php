### [3.0.0](https://github.com/munkireport/munkireport-php/compare/v2.15.2...v3.0.0) (February 07, 2018)

The third major version of munkireport attempts to solve a couple of longstanding issues concerning security, dependency management and database management. We're moving slowly to using eloquent as replacement for the KISS database abstraction. A ton of work has been done by @mosen to make this all work.

Most notable changes are:

- Minimum PHP version is 7.0
- Document root is now in a directory called `/public`. The best practice is to serve your munkireport instance from this directory or make a symlink to this directory.
- If you install munkireport via the commandline, you need to install all dependencies first via [composer](https://getcomposer.org)
- There is a new database configuration format `$conf['connection']`. See `config_default.php` on how to use it.
- Database migrations (also the initial ones) are not running automatically. You need to run migrations via the commandline tool `php database/migrate.php`
