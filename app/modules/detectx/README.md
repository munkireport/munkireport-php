DetectX Module
==============

**Admins are responsible for creating their own launch daemon that runs DetectX and provides the results data to:**
```
/usr/local/munki/preflight.d/cache/detectx.json
```

Module pulls data from DetectX Swift (requires Pro or Management License!) results `json`. It does not **run** DetectX!

Differences between Infection and Issue:
- Infections are things that DTXS canâ€™t remove simply by deleting files.
    - So, for example, they may include modifications of essential files or system settings.
    - If you ever get an infection, the best course of action is to contact support@sqwarq.com with details so that you can remediate it.
- Issues are something DTXS can deal with by simple file deletion and restart of the system
