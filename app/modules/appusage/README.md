# App Usage module
Idea and collaboration by @gmarnin

===============

Reports app usage and when app was last opened and closed


The results are stored in the table:

* id - Unique id
* serial_number - Serial Number
* event - Data of if app launched or quit
* bundle_id - Bundle ID app app event
* app_version - App version of app event
* app_path - Path of App of app event
* last_time_epoch - UNIX time of app event
* last_time - Human readable last time of app event
* number_time - How many times the app was launched or quitted

#Dependencies
Uses [crankd] (https://github.com/MacSysadmin/pymacadmin) and [ApplicationUsage.py] (https://github.com/google/macops/tree/master/crankd) for application usage gathering. You can download a prepackaged version of crankd and ApplicationUsage.py here: [https://github.com/munkireport/supplemental-packages/tree/master/AppUsage](https://github.com/munkireport/supplemental-packages/tree/master/AppUsage)

Starting with version 2.9.0 of Munki, this module will use Munki's app_usage_monitor database instead of the one generated by crankd. When running Munki 2.9.0 or later, it is no longer necessary to use crankd or ApplicationUsage.py. This module will first check for the Munki application_usage database, if it is not found it will fall back and use crankd's application_usage database.
