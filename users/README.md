# Local users

Users are defined by a file called `username.yml`
This file should contain the password hash called `password_hash`
You can generate these files by visiting `index.php?/auth/generate`

## Example:

`geronimo.yml`

contains

```yaml
password_hash: $P$BnYH6NRCRO1lWHK6rkjFb0s.CmDtmm0
```
